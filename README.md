# Unexpected Behavior with Null-Aware Operator in Getter

This repository demonstrates a potential issue related to null safety and the null-aware operator (`??`) in Dart.  The `bug.dart` file showcases a scenario where using `??` within a getter to provide a default value can mask an unexpected `null` value being assigned to a private variable.  The `bugSolution.dart` file offers a solution to handle this scenario more robustly.

## Problem Description

When a null value is assigned to the `_value` variable in the `MyClass` class, the getter `value` uses the null-aware operator (`??`) to return 0 as the default. While this avoids a runtime error, it might mask the fact that `_value` holds a null value. This could lead to unexpected results in other parts of the code.

## Solution

The solution involves handling the `null` scenario explicitly, either by throwing an exception, or logging an error message when the unexpected null is assigned to the private variable.
